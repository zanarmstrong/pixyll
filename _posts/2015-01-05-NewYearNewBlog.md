I've written online a bit in the past about what I learned while studying at [SFPC](http://sfpc.zanarmstrong.com/) and more generally on [another blog](http://zanstrong.wordpress.com/) hosted on Wordpress. But, I thought it was time to host a blog at my own domain name. I've also been missing an easy way to write regularly online, as it's a good forcing function for me to document things that seem minor as I do them but which are nice to have as a reference later on and can hopefully help others too. Enjoy!
