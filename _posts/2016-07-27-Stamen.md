I worked with Stamen this spring on 3 very interesting and varied projects: [National Geographic Amazon](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/explore-amazonia/#/Map/Compare/?nav=true&focus=Interactive), [Atlas of Emotions](http://www.paulekman.com/atlas-of-emotions/), and Berkeley's Metagenomics. 

To find out more... you can read some of the posts on Medium related to my work and these projects. 

Eric Rodenbeck interviewed me about these collaborations, which can be found [here](https://hi.stamen.com/stamen-exit-interview-zan-armstrong-d44d06e89d6d#.7ujmfgb3h). 

Nicolette, Eric Socolofsky, and I also wrote about building the Atlas of Emotions in [Embracing the Abstract in Visualized Data](https://hi.stamen.com/embracing-the-abstract-in-visualized-data-47044cee8bd3#.smx2e9c3n), [Finding Calm in the Atlas of Emotions](https://hi.stamen.com/finding-calm-in-the-atlas-of-emotions-185b2e665ff1#.6q7l436ev), and my own [The Shapes of Emotions](https://hi.stamen.com/the-shapes-of-emotions-72c3851143e2#.yb0exshga). 

I also wrote about the National Geographic project: [Exploring the Amazon with Code and Data](https://hi.stamen.com/exploring-the-amazon-with-code-and-data-5750afec6ef2#.ppsd8964m).
