Highlights of the last few days included: 

* Week 2 of the algorithms homework, sadly they haven't posted theory questions yet
* Helping a non-profit analyze some of their data
* Making [weather lines](weatherLines.zanarmstrong.com) and [weather circles](weather.zanarmstrong.com) fast enough to share
