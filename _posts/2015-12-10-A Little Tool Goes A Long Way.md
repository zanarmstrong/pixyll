Ian Johnson discovered that my [d3 number formatting helper tool](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/05c1e95bf7aa16c4768e) is now *the* Google "One Box" answer to searches for "d3 format number".

Pretty psyched that it's gotten so popular and people have found it helpful, given that it was just a scrappy little tool I made to help myself test out number formatting syntaxes. A good reminder that small things can be super useful, and it's worth sharing things even if unpolished.
