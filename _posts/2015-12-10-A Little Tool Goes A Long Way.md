Ian Johnson discovered that my [d3 number formatting helper tool](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/05c1e95bf7aa16c4768e) is now *the* Google "One Box" answer to searches for "d3 format number". I'm pretty excited :).  

When you make a tool to help solve your own problems, it's worth sharing since it seems likely that it will help others too. I appreciate that bl.ocks makes it so easy to share something like this.
