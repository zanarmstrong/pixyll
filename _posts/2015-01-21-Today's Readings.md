Started the day finally watching [Eric Rodenbecks's 2014 Eyeo](http://vimeo.com/112308535) talk that I had unfortunately missed seeing in person last year, but had heard that I had to see.  Very glad that I did.  It seems quite honest and humble which are two of the things that I value about the Eyeo community. 

Next up were a few articles on uncertainty sent my way by Aran Lunzer: [The Truth Wears Off](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears-off)about why scientific results fail to be replicable, [Revised Standards for Statistical Evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19313.full), and [The Problem with P Values: How Significant Are They Really?](http://phys.org/wire-news/145707973/the-problem-with-p-values-how-significant-are-they-really.html). These also reminded me of the [2010 paper on Graphical Inference for InfoVis](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/inference-infovis.html) which tested how reliably we could tell the difference between meaningful data and noise in data visualizations and on [this years InfoVis paper on encoding uncertainty into visualizations showing the results of statistical tests](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgraphics.cs.wisc.edu%2FPapers%2F2014%2FCG14%2FPreprint.pdf&ei=XB_AVP3FCI3ZoASrg4HQDg&usg=AFQjCNEff-tfpi1KfGtbpEaGWT1uJurJsw&sig2=Dnd_AEwqBZIUCpCFXA4s4A).

Following up on the first article, I found Ioannidis' ["Why Most Published Research Findings are False"](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124). The abstract states that "Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias."  Wow.
