I analyze and visualize data. More generally, I am curious about how things work, exploring information, ideas, and places, and sharing the experience of discovery with others. 

I studied math at Williams College including research in configuration spaces, taught high school juniors at Chewonki Semester School in Maine, and raced through the forests of Sweden orienteering. 

At Google, I was the lead analyst responsible for forecasting and analyzing global search ads revenue. Motivated by my work as an analyst, I developed a new charting style to visualize Simpson's paradox and related statistical issues. 

I am currently doing freelance work in analysis/interactive visualization and studying. I am always on the lookout for great people to work with and important/interesting data to analyze and visualize.

I presented this research at InfoVis in Paris in November 2014 and it was published in the Proceedings of IEEE InfoVis 2014, IEEE (23% acceptance rate). It's the result of my collaboration with Google's Data Visualization research group led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas. 

The slide deck from the presentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1glF_JcGVRIahzfrYyw9OKDDB9eWeUxpfD2vCDJTkTqo/edit?usp=sharing). 

Robert Kosera reviewed the presentation on his [Eager Eyes Blog](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2014/vis-2014-wednesday) and it was mentioned in Moritz Stefaner and Enrico Bertini's [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/data-stories-43-ieee-vis14/) podcast.
