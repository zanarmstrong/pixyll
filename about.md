I analyze and visualize data. More generally, I am curious about how things work, exploring information, ideas, and places, and sharing the experience of discovery with others.

My experience includes being the lead analyst for Google search ads revenue globally, teaching high school math, and creating data visualizations for varied clients. 

I am currently traveling the world, but will be back in early 2017. Contact me if you are interested to learn more or work together. 

## Open Vis Conf presentation

![](../images/everythingIsSeasonal.png)

In April  2016 I had the pleasure of presenting at OpenVisConf. I spoke about how "Everything is Seasonal", showing how seasonal patterns are an important part of our lives and our data.

## Data Viz Research

I presented this research at InfoVis in Paris in November 2014 and it was published in the Proceedings of IEEE InfoVis 2014, IEEE (23% acceptance rate). It's the result of my collaboration with Google's Data Visualization research group led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda ViÃ©gas.

The slide deck from the presentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1glF_JcGVRIahzfrYyw9OKDDB9eWeUxpfD2vCDJTkTqo/edit?usp=sharing).

Robert Kosera reviewed the presentation on his [Eager Eyes Blog](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2014/vis-2014-wednesday) and it was mentioned in Moritz Stefaner and Enrico Bertini's [Data Stories](http://datastori.es/data-stories-43-ieee-vis14/) podcast.

If you want to use your own data with a D3 version of comet charts, fork [this bl.ock](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/f7793345e15b0916d353ee33c54478c4).

For an R version, check out the example and code [here](https://gist.github.com/zanarmstrong/6c2855a34f504029847485c690692e75).  

At the Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago in 2016, I'll be sharing this research as part of an invited panel on Recent Advances in Information Visualization.

## PolicyViz Podcast

Jon Schawabish and I had a great conversation about seasonality, map projections, climate change, scrollytelling, and more as part of his PolicyViz podcast series. You can find it [here](http://policyviz.com/episode-54-zan-armstrong/).

## Freelance Projects

I worked with [Stamen](http://stamen.com/) on 3 very different projects: [National Geographic Amazon](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/explore-amazonia/#/Map/Compare/?nav=true&focus=Interactive), [Atlas of Emotions](http://www.paulekman.com/atlas-of-emotions/), and Berkeley's Metagenomics. To find out more, you can read some of my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zanarmstrong) related to my work and these projects. Eric Rodenbeck also interviewed me about these collaborations, which can be found [here](https://hi.stamen.com/stamen-exit-interview-zan-armstrong-d44d06e89d6d#.7ujmfgb3h). 

I've also worked with Yale Univeristy scientists to create a visual interface for exploring neuro-relevant genes based on quantitative data about their expression by celltype.

For the Google Fiber team, I analyzed data and built out an exploratory tool to help engineers discover factors affecting wifi speed.

I advised Kickstarter on revenue forecasting analysis.
