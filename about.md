I analyze and visualize data. More generally, I am curious about how things work, exploring information, ideas, and places, and sharing the experience of discovery with others. 

I studied math at Williams College, taught high school juniors at Chewonki Semester School in Maine, raced through the forests of Sweden, analyzed data and forecasted revenue at Google, and developed a new charting style to visualize Simpson's paradox. I am currently studying and doing freelance work in analysis and visualization, and am always on the lookout for great people to work with and important/interesting data to analyze and visualize. 

## Data Viz Research

I presented this research at InfoVis in Paris in November 2014 and it was published in the Proceedings of IEEE InfoVis 2014, IEEE. It's the result of my collaboration with Google's Data Visualization research group led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas. 

The slide deck from the presentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1glF_JcGVRIahzfrYyw9OKDDB9eWeUxpfD2vCDJTkTqo/edit?usp=sharing).
